Democrats push for more gun control. Reaction from Antonia Okafor Cover, spokesperson for Gun Owners Of America.
Senate
 Majority Leader 
Chuck Schumer
, D-N.Y., on Thursday vowed that the Senate would vote on the 
Bipartisan Background Checks Act
 of 2021, which passed the House Thursday in a 227-203 vote.
A prior version of the 
H.R. 8
 bill, which would require background checks for all U.S. firearm purchases, passed the House in 2019 but did not receive 60 votes in the Senate to clear the filibuster.
&#34;In the past, when they sent it over to us last time, it went into [fomer Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell&#39;s legislative graveyard,&#34; Schumer said during a press conference Thursday. &#34;The legislative graveyard is over. H.R. 8 will be on the floor of the Senate, and we will see where everybody stands. No more hopes and prayers, thoughts and prayers. A vote is what we need, a vote, not thoughts and prayers.&#34;
The House also passed H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Check Act, by a 219-210 vote Thursday. That bill would extend the amount of time to complete a federal background check before a gun purchase is approved.

Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., and 131 cosponsors reintroduced H.R. 8 on March 2.
&#34;Certainly hundreds of thousands -- maybe millions -- of people walking the streets today because we passed [the 1994 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act] would be dead,&#34; Schumer, who authored the Brady Act requiring background checks on all U.S. firearm buyers, said during the briefing.
BIDEN BACKS HOUSE GUN BACKGROUND CHECK BILLS THAT WOULD TIGHTEN RESTRICTIONS
He continued: &#34;But when we passed the law, little did we know, it had some loopholes in it that we didn&#39;t know at the time. We didn&#39;t know there would be an internet, so we didn&#39;t prohibit internet sales without a background check.&#34;
Democrats have criticized what they call the &#34;Charleston loophole&#34; after the 2015 Emanuel AME Church massacre in Charleston, South Carolina, which refers to current law that allows federal firearms licensees to proceed with a firearm transfer if a background check is not completed within three business days.
PSAKI CALLS GUN CONTROL A &#39;PRIORITY&#39; FOR BIDEN ADMIN
The shooter in the 2015 massacre, a white supremacist named Dylann Roof, obtained a firearm after law enforcement officials did not block the purchase within three days. H.R. 1446 would extend the three-day timeframe to 10 days. If no denial has been given in 10 days, a potential buyer could ask for a final determination. The purchase would be allowed if no decision is made in the following 10 days.
The National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action 
says
 the three-day window is a necessary &#34;safety valve&#34; and says without it, &#34;the FBI has no incentive to complete checks in a timely manner.&#34; Progressive organizations like the Center for American Progress, on the other hand, say it allows unstable Americans to &#34;evade the law and buy guns.&#34;

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., argued that the political landscape has changed since 2019, calling the NRA &#34;a shell of itself&#34; during Thursday&#39;s briefing in which fellow Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., discussed the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting that killed 26 people, including 20 children.
The 
Biden administration
 on Monday said it &#34;looks forward&#34; to working with Congress to strengthen the federal gun background check system and to implement &#34;commonsense&#34; steps to reduce gun violence, urging the House to pass two measures that would &#34;close existing loopholes&#34; in the system.

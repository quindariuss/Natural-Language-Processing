Among the most common provisions, according to Brennan's researchers: Measures in seven states that either expand officials' ability to purge voters from the registration rolls or put voters at risk at having their names improperly removed. Those laws were enacted in Arizona, Iowa, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Texas and Utah, the center found.
Three of the 18 states with new voting restrictions have passed sweeping, omnibus bills that cover a broad range of voting activity: 
Florida
, 
Georgia
 and 
Iowa
. 
Republican attempts to pass an omnibus bill in Texas have been thwarted by 
Democratic state lawmakers who fled the stat
e to deny Republican lawmakers from obtaining the quorum needed to conduct business. But their departure is likely to only delay action. Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has promised to call more special sessions to advance Republicans' election proposals.
Brennan's tally of individual statutes that restrict voting shows Arkansas and Montana leading the way, with four new laws apiece. Arizona was in second place with three new laws, including one that 
makes it harder to remain on the state's absentee voting list.
